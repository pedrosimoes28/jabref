I'm not sure "preferences" intervenes as an actor. In  "Export to MS Word",  I wonder if a connection with the GUI instead of the current with Preferences would be better. Despite my concerns, everything seems to be in order. Attention, something might have escaped my sight.

Addind to the previous review, in "Export to MS Word", reference to a remote database is made, but such is not defined within the actors, suggesting a gap in the secondary actors used. I am unsure if the reference to the remote database is a must in this particular case, and therefore suggest another reviewing of the content.
Aside from such, all else seems to be in order.
