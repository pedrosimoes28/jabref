After carefully examining the "Dispensable Comments" code smell, I conclude it seems to be correct.

 After analysing the first code smell, I conclude that the code snippet provided isn't an example of "Duplicated Code". Although there are 2 "if" conditions, its conditions aren't similar to one another, and therefore shouldn't be considered duplicated code.
